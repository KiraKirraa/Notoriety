# Notoriety
A caseboard-like note taking app

# TODO
- Add tabs as a visual representation of boards
- figure out how editing an item translates to  notes (probably just make item an interface and use getters/setters) same for boards and tabs
- figure out note layouts???
    - Potentially add categories??
    - Behaviour upon minimizing
- figure out linking content/notes
    - if a note contains a link to another note, but also a link to a web article??
    - potentially treat everything as a note (e.g. a copy-pasted image is just a note with an image field and a title)
- add a directory and note-searching
    - should notes be sorted by title rather than id??? how does item-note linking work???
- add calendar system (MUCH LATER)
